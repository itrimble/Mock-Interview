**Consulting: Things to think about**
*   A good consultant is a good listener first.
*   A good consultant can present ideas and perspective that would otherwise be hidden, due to that wider field of experience. 
*   How invested are you in the long term value of your recommendations? 
*   The truth is that you aren’t going to own the results unless they reflect greatly on yourself.
*   Are you going to develop any scar tissue from the ramifications of the recommendations?
*   Companies tend to value the ideas of consultants over the ideas of their employees ?  Why do you think that is?
*   Devils’s Advocate:  If employees were adequate, the consultants would never be called.
*   If consultants don’t have skin in the game, management never feels threatened with someone below them in the corporate heirarchy.
*   The real truth wish that external consultants usually come back with the same conclusion that staff do.
*   Senior executives like to use consultants in order to avoid the blame for anything that doesn’t go well.
*   A big reason to bring in a consultnant and pay them is to legitimisse what management already wants to do.  By having an “indpendent expert” third party say what it is that you want to do, the company can say that the course of action recommended and implemented by the consultant is based on ‘expert advice’.
*   **Hard** **Truth**: Feelings don’t matter in information security.
*   I can’t secure the things I know I don’t have.
*   Always look for places where you can simplify
*   Look for Duplication (Applications, Hardware)
*   If I can simplify things, I can save the company $$ (Quick Wins) - You will start to justify your existence even more.
*   Look for complex processes (Over engineered companies)
*   Look for areas of complexity
*   CISO’s are expecting their budget to increase.

*   **Salary Information:**  
    Ask yourself, how much are you worth ?
*   Salary pay ranges differ depending on where you live.

2.  Someone who is self sufficient.  SOmeone who can work in a team structure. Someone who can make decisions. 
3.  Someone who can plan, organize, and prioritize their work.  Employers don’t want to spend their time constantly babysitting.

Have an example of making a difficult a decision on your own.
Have examples for all of these. 
THey want someone who will go above and beyond what is expected.
Are you willing to do tasks outside of your comfort zone to stay late if needed?
You are always flexibible and go above and beyond.

**5 words you should use in your interview.**
1.  Instead of saying I’m a good team worker say : In this role, I will always colloborate with my co-workers to ensure we quickly meet the team’s objectives. (Colloborate is far more powerful than team work).
2.  Instead of saying I am hardworking say this instead: In my work, I am always DILIGENT, CONSCIENTIOUS, and I will never miss a deadline.
3.  Instead of saying I am professional say this instead: Whilst carrying out my duties I will always be COMPETENT and PROFICIENT.
4.  Instead of saying I am a good problem solver, say this instead: I am always SOLUTION-ORIENTED whilst dealing witch challenges and problems.

**One of the hardest Interview Quesitons You Will Have To Answer:  WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU?**
You should hire me for several reasons. I am a very positive person who enjoys the challenge of working on difficult tasks and projects.  Over the years, I have built up numerous transferrable skills and qualities that I believe are a solid match for this job description.  I have experience working alone and collaborating as part of a team. I  am a solid communicator who will take good care of your customers and clienets, and I will always go above and beyond what is expected in this role.

You should hire me because I appreciate you have worked hard to build your/this business and being someone who is adaptable to change, I can be relied upon to support your long-term commercial goals.

You should also hire me because I am a fast learner. This means you won’t have to spend your valuable time closely monitoring or supervising me.
