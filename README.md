**Questions to ask your Manager** 
1.  [What happens or how do you work if somebody doesn’t agree with you ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihZJy9L4ew8)
2.  Steve Jobs Answer: I just explain it to them until they understand. 
3.  Give me your definition of \[Job Title\] goes here. 


**Consulting: Things to think about**
*   A good consultant is a good listener first.
*   A good consultant can present ideas and perspective that would otherwise be hidden, due to that wider field of experience. 
*   How invested are you in the long term value of your recommendations? 
*   The truth is that you aren’t going to own the results unless they reflect greatly on yourself.
*   Are you going to develop any scar tissue from the ramifications of the recommendations?
*   Companies tend to value the ideas of consultants over the ideas of their employees ?  Why do you think that is?
*   Devils’s Advocate:  If employees were adequate, the consultants would never be called.
*   If consultants don’t have skin in the game, management never feels threatened with someone below them in the corporate heirarchy.
*   The real truth wish that external consultants usually come back with the same conclusion that staff do.
*   Senior executives like to use consultants in order to avoid the blame for anything that doesn’t go well.
*   A big reason to bring in a consultnant and pay them is to legitimisse what management already wants to do.  By having an “indpendent expert” third party say what it is that you want to do, the company can say that the course of action recommended and implemented by the consultant is based on ‘expert advice’.
*   **Hard** **Truth**: Feelings don’t matter in information security.
*   I can’t secure the things I know I don’t have.
*   Always look for places where you can simplify
*   Look for Duplication (Applications, Hardware)
*   If I can simplify things, I can save the company $$ (Quick Wins) - You will start to justify your existence even more.
*   Look for complex processes (Over engineered companies)
*   Look for areas of complexity
*   CISO’s are expecting their budget to increase.
