## Consulting: Things to Think About
* A good consultant is a good listener first.
* A good consultant can present ideas and perspective that would otherwise be hidden, due to that wider field of experience.
* How invested are you in the long-term value of your recommendations?
* The truth is that you aren't going to own the results unless they reflect greatly on yourself.
* Are you going to develop any scar tissue from the ramifications of the recommendations?
* Companies tend to value the ideas of consultants over the ideas of their employees. Why do you think that is?
* Devil's Advocate: If employees were adequate, the consultants would never be called.
* If consultants don't have skin in the game, management never feels threatened with someone below them in the corporate hierarchy.
* The real truth is that external consultants usually come back with the same conclusion that staff do.
* Senior executives like to use consultants in order to avoid the blame for anything that doesn't go well.
* A big reason to bring in a consultant and pay them is to legitimize what management already wants to do. By having an "independent expert" third party say what it is that you want to do, the company can say that the course of action recommended and implemented by the consultant is based on 'expert advice'.
* **Hard Truth**: Feelings don't matter in information security.
* I can't secure the things I know I don't have.
* Always look for places where you can simplify
* Look for Duplication (Applications, Hardware)
* If I can simplify things, I can save the company $$ (Quick Wins) - You will start to justify your existence even more.
* Look for complex processes (Over-engineered companies)
* Look for areas of complexity
* CISOs are expecting their budget to increase.

1. Preparation
2. Detection & Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity (After Action Reports, Lessons Learned)

### What is the OSI Model?
* **Physical** - The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes. It defines the connector, the electrical cable or wireless technology connecting the devices, and is responsible for transmission of the raw data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s, while taking care of bit rate control.
* **Data Link** - The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. It handles error detection and correction from the physical layer.
* **Network** - The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring packets from one node to another connected in different networks.
* **Transport** - The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.
* **Session** - The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers. It establishes, manages and terminates the connections between the local and remote application.
* **Presentation** - The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics.
* **Application** - The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application.

### What is the Cyber Kill Chain?
1. Reconnaissance
2. Weaponization
3. Delivery
4. Exploitation
5. Installation
6. Command and Control
7. Actions on Objectives

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework
The MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) Framework is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It provides a common language for describing attacker behaviors and helps organizations improve their security posture.

Key components:
* **Tactics**: The tactical goals of an adversary (the "why" of an attack technique)
* **Techniques**: The specific methods used by adversaries to achieve their tactical goals
* **Procedures**: The specific implementations of techniques used by adversaries

The framework is organized into matrices for different environments:
* Enterprise (Windows, macOS, Linux)
* Mobile (iOS, Android)
* ICS (Industrial Control Systems)

[MITRE ATT&CK Framework Website](https://attack.mitre.org/)

### Zero Trust Architecture
Zero Trust is a security concept that operates on the principle "never trust, always verify." It assumes that threats exist both inside and outside traditional network boundaries and requires strict identity verification for every person and device trying to access resources, regardless of their location.

Key principles:
* Verify explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
* Use least privilege access: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access
* Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access, verify end-to-end encryption, and use analytics to improve defenses

Implementation involves:
* Strong identity authentication
* Device health verification
* Microsegmentation
* Continuous monitoring and validation
* Policy-based access controls

## Tips

**Put yourself in the shoes of the interviewer and give them what they want, and what they are looking for from the successful candidate, you will pass your interview.**
The interviewer wants 3 things:
1. Someone who is positive and enthusiastic: smile, speak up. Don't be monotone or negative.
2. Someone who is self-sufficient. Someone who can work in a team structure. Someone who can make decisions.
3. Someone who can plan, organize, and prioritize their work. Employers don't want to spend their time constantly babysitting.

Have an example of making a difficult decision on your own.
Have examples for all of these.
They want someone who will go above and beyond what is expected.
Are you willing to do tasks outside of your comfort zone to stay late if needed?
You are always flexible and go above and beyond.

### 5 words you should use in your interview
1. Instead of saying I'm a good team worker say: In this role, I will always **collaborate** with my co-workers to ensure we quickly meet the team's objectives. (Collaborate is far more powerful than teamwork).
2. Instead of saying I am hardworking say this instead: In my work, I am always **diligent**, **conscientious**, and I will never miss a deadline.
3. Instead of saying I am professional say this instead: Whilst carrying out my duties I will always be **competent** and **proficient**.
4. Instead of saying I am a good problem solver, say this instead: I am always **solution-oriented** whilst dealing with challenges and problems.
5. Instead of saying I have high standards, say this instead: I am a **detail-oriented** person who can be relied upon to adhere to all company policies and procedures.

### One of the hardest Interview Questions You Will Have To Answer: WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU?
You should hire me for several reasons. I am a very positive person who enjoys the challenge of working on difficult tasks and projects. Over the years, I have built up numerous transferrable skills and qualities that I believe are a solid match for this job description. I have experience working alone and collaborating as part of a team. I am a solid communicator who will take good care of your customers and clients, and I will always go above and beyond what is expected in this role.

You should hire me because I appreciate you have worked hard to build your/this business and being someone who is adaptable to change, I can be relied upon to support your long-term commercial goals.

You should also hire me because I am a fast learner. This means you won't have to spend your valuable time closely monitoring or supervising me.

Finally, you should hire me because I will always take care of my ongoing professional development. This means the skills and knowledge I possess will always be purposeful and relevant to the position.

### Transferrable Skills
* Risk Management
* Fraud
* Merchant Disputes
* Customer Service Skills
* Inventory
* Communication
* Project Management
* Problem-Solving
* Critical Thinking
* Attention to Detail
* Documentation
* Technical Troubleshooting
* Research and Analysis
